            Alice is an engineering manager at a fast-paced technology company. She spends most of her day meeting with teams and coordinating projects. She has very little free time, but a colleague of hers has just sent over a 12-page article about the latest hot tech framework that everybody has been raving about. Alice is intrigued, but she doesn’t know how on earth she’ll find the time to read, especially as she’s unsure if that article will actually turn out to be useful! She sends the article to Hark and asks Hark to break it down into 6 bite-size summaries sent to her over 2 days. She receives the summaries over breakfast, lunch, and dinner and can quickly glance through them as she eats. After two days of gleaning over those summaries, she feels convinced that the article talks about a technology that has great potential and that could be crucial to her company. She decides to print out the original article and read through it thoroughly at her desk.

            Bobby is a sales representative at a building tools manufacturer. The whole of next week he is going to be manning a booth at one of the biggest construction conferences, talking to potential buyers. He knows that there will be a lot of time just standing around waiting for customers to come up to him. Recently, he has been keen on getting back into reading, a hobby that he enjoyed so much as a child, and his best friend has just recommended him a Sci-Fi book that looks like it’d be a lot of fun. Bobby sends the book to Hark and selects the “Original Snippets” option and chooses to receive 8 snippets per day over the next week. This way he is reminded throughout the day to keep on reading every time he glances at his phone when things get quiet at the booth, rather than falling into the infinite scroll of social media apps.

            Charlie is a cognitive psychology university student. But he’s one of those busy students, always on the go. He’s involved in three student organizations, has a part-time job as a cook in the evening, and on the weekends loves to chill with his friends. One of his teachers has assigned him to read a combination of around 60 pages from different psychology papers and books to prepare for Tuesday’s afternoon class discussion. It’s Thursday already, and poor Charlie hasn’t had the time to even sneak a peek at the reading material. He decides to use his old friend Hark. He gathers together the texts into a single PDF and fires it off to Hark, and asks to receive summaries of the main ideas explored in the material and a summary of author biographies 6 times a day from here until Monday evening. This way, throughout his busy day, he can make progress on his reading assignment while walking between two student meetings, during a shift break at work, while one of his friends has popped out to grab a pack of beers and even while he’s on the shitter! By Tuesday morning, he’s all clued in on the varying subtleties of Metacognition Theory and is able to participate in the class debate with great success!

            Diana has just finished the newest book from one of her favorite gurus about pragmatic mindfulness. It’s jam-packed with many practical tips on how to improve her focus and concentration throughout the day, and how to remain calm under even the most stressful situations. All this is incredibly useful and relevant advice for her role as a lead accountant at a prominent auditor firm. However, Diana is worried that in a matter of days, all this great advice contained in the book will start to drift away and will become just a blur. After all, it’s happened to her before with other books she really loved. She decides to send the book to Hark and requests to get super-condensed 50-word-long summaries of different parts of the book. She elects to receive one bite-size summary per day over the next 30 days. Thanks to this, Diana now receives a timely reminder during her morning coffee break, summarizing one of the key concepts of the book. These daily messages help Diana over the next month to really put into practice the book’s main methods and to implement in her life the powerful habit of clear-minded focus discussed throughout the book she enjoyed so much.
